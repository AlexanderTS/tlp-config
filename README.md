What does TLP Configurator do?

Traditional way to configure TLP is to edit text configuration file (more information about TLP configuration can be found here http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html). tlp-config brings you graphical TLP configuration with hints and useful information. It uses GTK+3, so you need GTK+3 and Glib libraries  to compile it.
